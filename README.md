# Searchable Listvew Native

This widget is the spiritual successor to GridSearch, and adds the ability to configure advanced filtering controls to
listviews on native.

### TODO:

-   Add support for numeric filter types => added Big.js comparison operators and GT/GTE/LT/LTE numeric operators ✅
-   Change the constraints to be "AND"ed => changed `constraints.some()` to `constraints.every()` ✅
-   Remove the filterContent placeholder => removed ✅
-   Add support for datetime types
-   Allow one source value to be searched in multiple target attributes(?)
