# Searchable Listvew Native

This widget is the spiritual successor to GridSearch, and adds the ability to configure advanced filtering controls to
listviews on native.

### TODO:

-   Add support for numeric filter types
-   Change the constraints to be "AND"ed
-   Allow one source value to be searched in multiple target attributes(?)
